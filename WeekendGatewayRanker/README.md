# 🧭 Visit Place Recommendation System

This project is a **Python-based recommendation system** that suggests travel destinations based on structured data.  
The system is implemented using a **Jupyter Notebook** and focuses on data analysis and recommendation logic for tourism use cases.

---

## 📘 Notebook Overview

**Notebook:** `visitPlaceRecommendation.ipynb`  

The notebook demonstrates:
- Loading and exploring travel destination data
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset
- Recommending places based on features such as popularity, category, or region
- Data-driven insights for travel planning

---

## 📂 Dataset Used

**File:** `Top Indian Places to Visit.csv`

The dataset contains information about:
- Tourist destinations in India
- Place categories (e.g., hill station, heritage, beach)
- State or region
- Popularity or ranking-related attributes

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🧹 Data cleaning and preprocessing
- 🗺 Place recommendation logic
- 🇮🇳 Focused on Indian tourist destinations
- 🧪 Interactive execution using Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** *(if used for visualization)*
- **Scikit-learn** *(if recommendation logic is ML-based)*
